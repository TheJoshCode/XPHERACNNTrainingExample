# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

This project demonstrates a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x (Ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH)
- Internet connection (for downloading the CIFAR-10 dataset)

### 2. Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the Repo into an Empty Folder:
      $ git clone https://github.com/TheJoshCode/XPHERACNNTrainingExample.git

2. **Run the Installation Script**  
   In the project directory, run the `install.bat` file. This will:
   - Create a virtual environment (`venv`) if it doesn't exist.
   - Install the required Python libraries (`tensorflow` and `scikit-learn`).
   - Download and extract the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - Train the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

   To run the batch script, double-click `install.bat` or run the following command in a command prompt:
   ```bash
   install.bat
